# manifold

An **atlas of computed mathematics** — interactive math illustrations, statically hosted on
GitHub Pages and built with TypeScript + Vite. Computational-terminal styling (Manifold design
system): monospace-forward, dark/light with a phosphor accent.

Live: **[manifold.tamino.dev](https://manifold.tamino.dev)**

## Illustrations

- **Chessboard Patterns** — pieces drop onto a counter-clockwise number spiral, each taking the
  lowest-indexed cell no opposing piece attacks. Watch it fill with an accelerating, smoothly
  zooming animation (cell 1 stays centered), scrub the timeline, and configure pieces (color,
  movement grid, weight) and placement order in the studio panel. Scales to 100k pieces — the
  placement is computed in a Web Worker with a progress bar so the UI never freezes.

## Theme

Dark and light are both first-class and **auto-selected from the OS** (`prefers-color-scheme`),
with a manual toggle (persisted) in the header.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start the dev server
npm test           # run unit tests (Vitest)
npm run lint       # Biome lint + format + import-order check
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run build      # production build to dist/
```

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which lints, typechecks, tests, builds,
and deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages. The custom domain is configured via `public/CNAME`
(`manifold.tamino.dev`).

**One-time setup:** in the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**, and
point the `manifold.tamino.dev` DNS record at GitHub Pages.

## Adding an illustration

1. Create `src/illustrations/<name>/` with a `main.ts` and a `preview.ts`.
2. Add `<name>/index.html` at the repo root and register it as an input in `vite.config.ts`.
3. Add an entry to `src/gallery/registry.ts`.

The Manifold design tokens live in `src/styles/manifold/` — link `styles.css` and use the CSS
custom properties (`--accent`, `--surface`, `--font-mono`, the `.ds-label`/`.ds-grid-bg`/`.ds-dot-bg`
utilities, etc.) so new pages inherit the theme automatically.
